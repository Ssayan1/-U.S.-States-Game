# 🗺️ U.S. States Game

This interactive game helps you learn the 50 U.S. states by name and location using the Python `turtle` graphics module and `pandas`.

## 🎮 How It Works

- A blank U.S. map is displayed.
- The user guesses U.S. state names.
- Correct guesses are labeled on the map.
- If you type `Exit`, the game ends and generates a list of states you missed.

## 🗂️ Files

- `us_states_game.py`: Game logic
- `50_states.csv`: Contains state names and x/y coordinates for labeling
- `blank_states_img.gif`: Background image of the U.S. map
- `states_to_learn.csv`: Auto-generated list of states you didn’t guess

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- turtle (comes with Python)

Install pandas with:

```bash
pip install pandas
